i) Basic SQL query:
 Select column1, column2 from table (where column1='xxx')  
Output of above statement is:
 Column1   Column2 
 sss       akhil
 hello     jello
 cello     tatti  
If you say Select * from table ( where column2 = 'xyz') Then you will get output all coloumns 
ii) Use of Union 

Union adds some more rows to the rows already there by select. Just one condition is that union should be with statements which 
have the same number of columns as that one before.
Example : select column1, column2 from table union select column1, column2 from table2
Observe that both selects have some number of columns

To get all databases command: Select table_schema from information_schema.schemata
To get all tables in your databse : Select table_name from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()
To get all columns in one particular table: Select column_name from information_schema.columns where table_schema=database() and table_name='tablenamehere'
Once we know the columns, we can get the data from mySql as folows : Select column1,column2 from 'tablename'


iii) Get all Data:
select * from table where userId='1'OR '1'='1
select * from table where userId=1 OR 1=1
